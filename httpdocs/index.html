                    <h2>Josh</h2>
                    <p>Josh is a talented multiinstrumentalist who has fifteen years playing experience and a BA Honours degree in Popular Music. He is a classically trained pianist, synthesiser player in a local Progressive Rock band, acoustic songwriter, specialising in fingerpicking and the more modern styles shown by artists such as Jon Gomm, and singer in a local covers group.</p>

                    <h2>Chris</h2>
                    <p>Chris has been playing bass since back in the late nineties out of a love of listening to the low end, especially players like Flea, Bootsy Collins, Andy Rourke, James Jamerson and Scott Reeder.</p>
                    <p>His musical background started with piano and then playing tenor sax in a school jazz band. Over the last 20 years Chis has moved back and forth between electronic production, DJing and playing bass and still likes to combine the three areas.</p>
                    <p>Having played in bands ranging from Blues Rock to Heavy Psychedelic, Chris brings a dark, and heavy but funk influenced sound to his bass playing. He also has a large collection of analogue effects pedals and loves to add some distorted textures to the mix.</p>

                    <h2>Jarod</h2>
                    <p>Jarod started playing music as a teenager and hasn't stopped. He started out with trumpet and ended up with a guitar and a mic as the lead singer for "Hendry House Blues Band". As the years went by he realized the music scene in his small town of rural Georgia was in desperate need of percussionists and started to play drums.</p>
                    <p>As a drummer Jarod has toured most of the East Coast and the Mid West of the United States, working in various genres from country western to reggae and even some hard rock/new metal. After “hopping the pond” he found the Primates and has been working diligently writing and recording the upcoming album.</p>
                    <p>He holds a Masters Degree from the School of Hard Knocks which he attended while working for a charity to feed starving musicians.</p>

                    <h2>Neil</h2>
                    <p>Neil's love of electronic music was first awoken in the 80s by the video game soundtracks of composers such as Rob Hubbard. A hearty diet of Tangerine Dream, JM Jarre and Mike Oldfield paved the way for a short-lived career in 90s EDM; signing to A&M records.</p>
                    <p>Unimpressed with the business end of the music world Neil set off to have some sonic fun for the next decade. He finally tired of four on the floor and focused on classical piano for several years.</p>
                    <p>The demands of fatherhood put music on the back burner for a while only to resurface exploring prog rock keys and ambient strangeness.</p>
