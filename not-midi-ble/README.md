# !MIDIBLE

This is my attempt at making a MIDI controller that listens to BLE messages and converts them across to a MIDI track!

## Requirements

First install NodeJS on your machine:\
https://nodejs.org/

Then you need to follow the requirements for getting noble working:\
https://github.com/noble/noble/

Then in a terminal change to the directory this file is contained in and run this:

```bash
npm i
```

Finally, run the app:  

```bash
npm start
```
